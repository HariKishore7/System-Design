Methods:
Post, get, put/patch, delete
Head -> it doesn't modify anything, it just reads the headers
Options -> used for security purposes, if the api is allowed to make the request to diff domain. Like from flipkart -> google
Connect -> It used to establish the connection b/w the resources, so it doesn't need to do handshake everytime it requests something.
Trace -> used to do some tracing, and for diagnosis
