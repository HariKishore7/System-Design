Hydration -> means it adds listeners to the web page for interactions after javascript got rendered on the screen.

In CSR, initially browser is going to load html from client side. https://github.com/namastedev/namaste-frontend-system-design/blob/master/Performance/RenderingPatterns/page-router/src/pages/csr-page.js

In SSR, server is going to load html from server then the hydration will happen. https://github.com/namastedev/namaste-frontend-system-design/blob/master/Performance/RenderingPatterns/page-router/src/pages/ssr-page.js

In SSG, at the time of build itself it'll create a static site, when the browser hits it instantly gives, this can be used for blogs and for static sites where data won't change overtime.

React Server Component: https://vercel.com/blog/understanding-react-server-components
We can make few of the components to render on server and few on client.
So to make it to run on server, 'use server"
To make it run on the client, 'use client'.
