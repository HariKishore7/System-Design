Core web vitals:

Largest Contentful paint: How much time it took to render the page, so that the user can consume.
First Input delay: Once after we click on something, and the time it took to return the response. The delay is call FID.
Cumulative Layout Shift: When user performs a scroll, and when the page has loaded something new, or expanded the image, or something got loaded at that point called as CLS.
