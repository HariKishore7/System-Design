Progressive Web Applications (PWAs): It's a website, but behaves like an app in android or iOS

It works only when service worker and manifest is available.

The website page can be added as an app in mobile.
And can be used as an offline app.
Background sync, ex: whatsapp, even on offline we send a msg, once the network available, it'll send the msg.
Responsive & Mobile first.
