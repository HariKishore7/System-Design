Service Workers:

Service workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests, and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.

Service worker works on another thread, and can't access DOM, and local storage and all, as its running on a different thread.
Its an event driven. When an event happens this can be triggered.

self.addEventListener("install",e =>{
    e.wait
})
self.addEventListener("activate",e =>{
    
})
self.addEventListener("fetch",e =>{
    
})
