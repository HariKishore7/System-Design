Short Polling:
![alt text](image.png)

The client is going to keep on asking the data or checking the data from server is short polling.
Like for every 5sec, like does server have a new notification or new data, if yes return it. if no data, server informs no new notification.

Every connection is a short live connection
No Persistent connection
Less resource utility
problem when scaling happens, as if 1 million pings for every 5sec for some new data.

Can be done using setInterval on frontend, like keep on hitting the API for every 5 seconds.
